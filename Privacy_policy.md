# Privacy Policy for Calculator
I built the *Calculator* app as a free application. This app is provided as-is and is intended for use as-is.  

---

## 1. Information Collection and Use
I value your privacy. *Calculator does not collect, store, use, or share any personal information* from users.  
The app runs entirely offline and does not require any data to function.  

---

## 2. Permissions
The app does not request or require any sensitive permissions (such as camera, microphone, location, or contacts).  
If future features need a permission, it will be used only for that feature and disclosed here.

## 3. Childrenâ€™s Privacy
This app is suitable for all ages. Since no personal data is collected, it aligns with principles under *COPPA* and similar global regulations.  

---

## 4. Changes to This Privacy Policy
I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted publicly on this page.  
Users are encouraged to review this policy periodically for updates.
